Hello!

## What is this?

This repository contains the outcome of the homework that had to be done for the 
[Google Study Jams 2015](http://developerstudyjams.com/). It is a Android fundamentals
study world wide, hosted by local Google Developer Groups. I am visiting the one 
of [DutchAUG](www.dutchaug.org).

## Homework 

Every lesson has some homework, I decided to publish that here. 

- [x] Lesson 1
- [x] Lesson 2
- [ ] Lesson 3
